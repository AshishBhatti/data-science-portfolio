### Machine Learning

| Notebook                                                                                                     | Description |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [covid19-detection-using-chest-xrays](https://coursera.org/share/97a33444e9f05323d7e3b8b2eea60417)           | Classification of chest x-ray images into 3 classes normal, pneumatic and covid-19. Implemented ResNet-18 model on covid19-radiography-dataset.|
| [predicting-house-prices](https://coursera.org/share/88a480a84e876bf84bc8c2ecfd203fcc)                       | Implemented basic regression model to predict the house prices.                                                                                |
| [ml-app-auto-mpg-efficiency](https://github.com/ashishbhatti/ml-app-auto-mpg-efficiency)                     | Trained & tested Linear Regression, Decision Tree, SVM and Random Forest Models, to predict Miles Per Gallon (MPG) value of a vehicle. **_Deployed_ the best performing Random Forest Model on Render.**                                                                              |


_Tools: scikit-learn, Pytorch, Seaborn, Matplotlib, TensorFlow_


### Computer Vision

- [real-time-embedded-object-detection](https://github.com/AshishBhatti/real-time-embedded-object-detection): CNN architectures of Two-Stage & One-Stage Object Detection algorithms were studied & optimized models were tested. Optimized models of YOLO series, PP-PicoDet, PP-YOLO-TIny were deployed on RPi 3B+ using ncnn, Tensorflow Lite, Pytorch. 

_Tools: Pytorch, Tensorflow, ncnn_
