## Projects
Following are a few projects that I've completed in the Machine Learning fields:


### Computer Vision

- [real-time-embedded-object-detection](https://github.com/AshishBhatti/real-time-embedded-object-detection): CNN architectures of Two-Stage & One-Stage Object Detection algorithms were studied & optimized models were tested. Optimized models of YOLO series, PP-PicoDet, PP-YOLO-TIny were deployed on RPi 3B+ using ncnn, Tensorflow Lite, Pytorch. 

_Tools: Pytorch, Tensorflow, ncnn_



### Machine Learning

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [covid19-detection-using-chest-xrays](https://coursera.org/share/97a33444e9f05323d7e3b8b2eea60417)           | Classification of chest x-ray images into 3 classes normal, pneumatic and covid-19. Implemented ResNet-18 model on covid19-radiography-dataset.|
| [predicting-house-prices](https://coursera.org/share/88a480a84e876bf84bc8c2ecfd203fcc)                       | Implemented basic regression model to predict the house prices.                                                                                |
