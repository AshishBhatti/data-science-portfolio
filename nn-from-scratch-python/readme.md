This is the repository to make me understand the very basics of deep learning. This contains the notes and code which have helped me grasp the concepts. This is also the repository which will contain the tools I will be generating for the use in my future projects.

The resources I will be using:
1. (Main) Neural Networks from Scratch
2. MIT Deep Learning
3. Deep Learning Specialization Coursera
