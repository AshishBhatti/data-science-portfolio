    "# Introducing Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective:\n",
    "1. To learn how to implement Neural Networks from Scratch.\n",
    "2. By doing this learn and remember the basics of Neural Networks.\n",
    "3. Create a set of code and functions which I can use later while implementing projects.\n",
    "4. Also create code in cpp, so that I can implement it in embedded format.\n",
    "5. Compare it with actual biological neural networks and liquid neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Method:\n",
    "1. Read the book and make notes in question and answer format.\n",
    "2. Make inline notes in the book itself.\n",
    "3. Whatever I write here is in my own language.\n",
    "4. **Feynmann Technique** : Think of yourself as a noob and you are trying to teach yourself, not to anyone else.\n",
    "5. First read the book, make inline notes, try to understand there. And then make notes here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I will write the questions here and try to answer in my own words once I am done reading the chapter. Also I will write the code in C++, so that I have the code I can use to implement NNs in C++."
